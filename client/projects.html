        <h1><a href="/projects.html">Work</a></h1>
        <p>
            Here I've documented most of the work I've done either for companies, throughout my education, and also many hobby projects.

        <h1><a href="/workpages/software1.html">Professional Work</a></h1>
        <p>
            This is where the majority of my professional experience lies, primarily on the backend side. It includes work ranging from website design, API work, backend algorithm and data processing, and
            even server administration.
        </p>

        <h1><a href="/workpages/software2.html">Other Software Work</a></h1>
        <p>
            This section includes other software related work but with most of it education or hobby related. Here I've included some full-stack web app development as well as examples of some of my 
            earliest programs and scripts.
        </p>

        <h1><a href="/workpages/other.html">Other Work</a></h1>
        <p>
            In this section I have placed any work that resides outside of software development. Here are some examples of my work with hardware circuits, 3D graphics, and a number of wacky science/physics
            related school and hobby projects.
