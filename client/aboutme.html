        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I was once in fact a math and physics nerd. I found it interesting and complex, there was always something to learn. I spent most of high school competing in math 
            contests and science fairs, and the rest of the time reading about the weird modern branches of physics. Computers and particularly software seemed
            shallow at the time. Yet, I tried it once. I tried it twice. I learned to modify my favourite video games to my will. It kept me awake for multiple nights, it
            was something greater than interesting. It was real. It was the realization of my mind's imagination. By the time I finished high school, I had already acquired 
            work experience in the field. I then found out in which direction I was going.

            I am currently working as a software developer with Sears Canada, part of their new division of <a class="textlink" href="http://www.searsinitium.com/">Sears Initium</a>. At the same time I'm currently working towards a diploma with triOS college in
            Toronto. Along with this busy schedule, I'm currently working on a web/android/iOS app (not yet posted on this site) using a full MEAN stack and some interesting new javascript frameworks and 
            tools, such as Meteorjs and Cordova. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Before Sears Canada, I spent some time with a small group at Disrupt.TO and a slightly bigger group at FCB Toronto. These two companies helped set the direction 
            that my career would later take. A mixture of frontend and backend, the boundaries increasingly blurred as new tools such as javascript are able to make both
            ends meet in surprisingly real-time.
