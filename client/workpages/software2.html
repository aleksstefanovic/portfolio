        <h1>Pandora Virtual Assistant</h1>
        <p>
            A hobby project, <a class="textlink" href="http://pandora0.herokuapp.com">Pandora</a> is a simple cloud based virtual assistant built on nodejs. Hosted on the free service 
            <a class="textlink" href="https://www.heroku.com/home">Heroku</a> , she is comprised by three major components. A Postgres database provides storage of data, an express web server to host the 
            REST API, and the actual API itself written in nodejs. To interface with Pandora, I have built a simple android app with voice recognition that will make the appropriate web service calls to
            the site to interpret the user's query. Currently she only knows a few basic commands. In addition to the above, I have built into her the ability to respond with the current temperature of my
            home. This was done with a very basic circuit, combining a temperature sensor and an arduino to transmit the data to a local PC, which updates Pandora's Postgres database.  You can find all the
            source code below:

            A comedic website built out of solely Microsoft technologies. Built with C# and ASP.NET, using Microsoft SQL, and hosted on the Azure platform. It tells the story
            of a fictional character who is constantly on the search for students who break coding best practice. The website is fully functional with fake store and user
            accounts. Check it out at <a class="textlink" href="http://peckolpreventionproject.azurewebsites.net">peckolpreventionproject.azurewebsites.net</a>

           One of my first java programs. Its has a very simple purpose, to keep track of books and their ISBN numbers through a series of files. Through a commandline 
            interface, a user can update, add, and remove books. It essentially behaves like a very simple library book-keeping software.

        <h1>Video Game "sudo"</h1>
        <p>
           A hobby project currently in development, it is a deceptively simple three-dimensional realtime strategy game for PC. With minimalistic graphics, a huge amount of
            variety and strategy, as well as fast-paced multi-task heavy gameplay, sudo (named after "super user do" in linux systems) is meant to be an evolution of the 
            genre pioneered by games such as Starcraft, Warcraft, Age of Empires, etc. It is being developed in Unity, using a mixture of built in tools and C#. An 
            unfinished (and unplayable) prototype can be built from source below. This project is the reincarnation of a number of other failed game related projects done in 
            CryEngine, Unreal Engine, and Starcraft 2 Game Editor.

        <h1>Starcraft 2 Video Game Modding</h1>
        <p>
           One of my first introductions into programming, Starcraft 2 was a realtime strategy game, sequel to the legendary original Starcraft. The game was sold with a 
           game editor, which allowed anyone to modify the game's source code and make changes or even entirely different games. Spending many hundreds of hours in this 
            editor taught me many of the fundamentals of computer programming and logic. Below is included two examples from a large pool of many projects I worked on.
