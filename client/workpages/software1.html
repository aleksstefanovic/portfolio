        <h1>Smartphone Braille Adapter</h1>
        <p>
            This was a project I worked on while on a short contract at FCB Toronto. It was a simple 3D printed smartphone case, but instead it went overtop the user's screen, and provided tactile braille
            feedback for the blind. Different cheap adapters were designed to work for different common and popular apps, but the team also worked on our own basic android apps designed for the adapter.
            The adapter I designed was fairly simple, in the centre of the plastic buttons was a tiny copper sheet, attached to a copper spring, which touched the screen with another copper sheet. The
            user needed only to press the button, and similar to regular touch screens, the body's natural current would be conducted through the coper material to interface with the app beneath. We finished
            a basic prototype, but the project never went into production.

        <p>
            Working with a small Toronto startup, Distrupt.TO, the team entered the Hacking Health Toronto 2015 competition. Our product was known as the LifeNode Project, a webapp that assisted 
            mental healthcare professionals by providing direct communication with their patients at all times and sentiment analysis on their conversations. I worked primarily on the integration between our
            frontend and backend. Since the entire app was built using the MEAN stack, this meant all integration was through javascript, both client and server side. We won the people's choice award at the
            contest.

        <h1>Sears Canada Ecommerce API</h1>
        <p>
            While working for the Sears Canada retail company (part of the new Sears Initium division) I developed the majority of the Sears Canada Ecommerce API on the 
            <a class="textlink" href="https://apigee.com/api-management">apigee</a> platform. The API is fully REST architected and written in primarily asynchronous javascript (similar to nodejs). It allows retrival and 
            input of key transactions into the Sears system, included sales orders, purchase orders, fulfillments, shipments, cash sales, order status, inventory status and management, and Sears store
            management. It is currently an internal API, but may one day be distributed with limited functionality to external developers.

        <h1>Sears Canada Logistics/WMS Backend</h1>
        <p>
           A major project at the Sears Initium sub-division within Sears Canada was a complete redesign of the logistics and warehouse management (WMS) backend. Starting with
            <a class="textlink" href="http://www.netsuite.com/portal/home.shtml">NetSuite</a> as our cloud ERP and <a class="textlink" href="https://www.logfire.com">Logfire</a> 
            as our WMS, we worked to integrate and customize these two systems to work for the business. This work was mainly done with a mixture of nodejs and java. A 
            specific and significant application that I worked on for this area was a java application that could communicate transactions from Logfire upstream to NetSuite
            via a set of webservices provided by NetSuite.
