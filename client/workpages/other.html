        <h1>Smart Home Prototype</h1>
        <p>
           One of the earliest prototypes of what I now refer to as <a class="textlink" href="/workpages/software2.html">Pandora</a>, Yeni (Youthful Energetic Natural 
            Intelligence) was a mishmash different scripts. Yeni could read the temperature and respond to basic questions similar to Pandora. Some key differences included
            that Yeni was a local piece of software that ran off a usb, and she was primarily coded in a weird combination of C (for arduino) and Visual Basic. Yeni also used
            a specific text-to-speech API, known as <a class="textlink" href="https://www.ivona.com">Ivona</a>. The eventual goal of Yeni was to be able to control parts of
            a home, through hardware and mechanical devices connected through WiFi.

        <h1>Utility Glove</h1>
        <p>
            The utility glove project was one of my attempts to make something solely using arduino. The concept was a glove that a user wore, which provided a number of 
            different sensors of the nearby environment and displayed that data onto a connected LCD screen on the user's wrist. The project was abandoned due to its lack of
            useful practical applications.

        <h1>Retro Hardware Video Game</h1>
        <p>
           My only project, done with a friend, that was entirely done in hardware. Using the verilog language, and a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), we built a very 
            basic retro style video game but entirely from the hardware up. This included the design and coding of logic gates for functionality, flip-flops for memory, and  
            a custom VGA adapter for displaying pixels. The source code is provided below, but since it is only a hardware description, it cannot be compiled like software 
            onto a user's machine. A FPGA must be used, or the hardware manufactured.

        <h1>Smartphone Computer</h1>
        <p>
           A project currently in development, it revolves around creating an adapter that can turn a smartphone (in this case an LG G5) into a fully functional laptop/desktop
            replacement. The phone provides memory, cpu, video, and hard disk storage. Running any distribution of linux, all the user need do it plug in a keyboard of any
            kind and a monitor, and they can perform work they normally do on any normal machine. With the constant increase in the power of smartphones, this is becoming a 
            very valid option in the near future. Currently only prototype is done, the second stage being building a laptop like "shell" which the phone can plug into to give             the user a full keyboard and monitor to use.

        <h1>Animated Logo Design</h1>
        <p>
           It has been a long time entertaining passion of mine to invent fictional companies. At times I have taken steps to create fictional logos and designs for these
            companies. Below are two examples of animated logos I have made when learning Blender. All visuals and sounds are made entirely by me.

        <h1>Fictional Company Logo</h1>
        <p>
           Another set of fictional company logos similar to what is explained above, but this time done completely in Adobe Illustrator with no animations. The name "Phnks" 
        is actually meant to be pronounced Phoenix. Its a play on words between the symmetry of "Alex" and "Phoenix"; and "Aleks" and "Phnks". The pdf can be
            downloaded below:

        <h1>Cyberpunk Book Cover</h1>
        <p>
           My only attempt at creating something interesting in Photoshop. A bizarre book cover demonstrating some of the horrors, and disturbing beauty, of a world dominated
            with advanced human changing technology.

        <h1>Physics Video Game Machinima</h1>
        <p>
            Throughout high school I often employed the use of the Starcraft 2 editor to create animated videos for a variety of school projects. This one being for a course 
            in modern physics, teaches about the weird dilemmas a space faring race may encounter.
