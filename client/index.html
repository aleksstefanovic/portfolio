            My name is Aleksandar Stefanovic. I’m a programmer. I love it, I’ve been doing it since I was twelve, and I can’t
            imagine doing anything else. At a young age I’ve worked for startups as small as three
            people to companies as big as twenty thousand. I bring software agility, I’m about
            seizing the goal even with many obstacles and all in record time. It’s what this career is
            about, it’s what software companies are looking for, and most importantly, it’s what I
            provide.

            I've delved into a wide variety of techonolgy and computing fields, science experiments and contests in high school, general mechanical engineering clubs/teams,               to eventually computer hardware and software. For more examples of my work please refer to the Work page above in the navigation. You can visit my LinkedIn in the
            upper right, as well as download my resume from the About Me page.
